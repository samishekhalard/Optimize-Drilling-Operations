#ROP Prediction and Analysis 
Developed a predictive model for ROP in drilling operations using machine learning techniques.
Analyzed and visualized drilling data to identify trends and correlations.
Implemented various data visualization techniques such as line plots, scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps to understand the data distribution and relationships between variables.
Constructed a pipeline for model training, including data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation.
Utilized Gradient Boosting Regressor for ROP prediction and achieved high accuracy.
Implemented Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize drilling parameters and maximize ROP.
